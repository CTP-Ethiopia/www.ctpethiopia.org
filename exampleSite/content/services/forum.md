CTP has a lot of ways to still connect with alumni from different years and help them reach their goals. One of our most important resources is a conversation with one another and with CTP mentors. And for this, CTP has the right resources - we have created a new forum platform. The platform can be found at [forum.ctpethiopia.org](https://forum.ctpethiopia.org "Forum")

If you are looking for the old forum(CTP Piazza) and how to sign up, click [here](/ctp-s-piazza-page-personalized-answers-to-your-questions/ "Piazza").
