**UPDATE**

CTP's Technology Team has created a website customized for forums which can be found at [forum.ctpethiopia.org](https://forum.ctpethiopia.org "Forum"). You can continue using Piazza for now, but we strongly recommend using CTP Forum since it is very easy to work with.

# CTP’s Piazza Page, Personalized Answers to Your Questions!

Are you looking for that place where you can ask all the questions you can think of about the college application process? Are you looking for an easier way to access lots of information about the college application process instead of tediously searching for your questions on Google? CTP is here for you! Let us introduce you to Piazza, one of the precious resources of most college students. Piazza is a question and answer platform that allows you, our mentees, to directly connect with multiple mentors who can answer any of your questions (you can even ask anonymously!) Interested yet? ​Join the ever-growing discussion and never miss out! It’s easy. Just follow the following simple steps, and ready those unanswered questions!

## Step 1

* Go to [**this Piazza page **](https://piazza.com/counseling_and_test_preparation_ctp)that gives you a list of courses to join. (Don’t worry, you’ll have to enter just one!)
* First, make sure the _Selected Term_ is “**Other**” and enter “**CTP 401: CTP Discussion Forum**” on the field _Class 1_.

## Step 2

* Select the only course that appears below the search field.
* You should then have an option to select what you are _joining as_. Select **student.**
* It also inquires for an _access code_. Enter “**ctp401**” on that field and hit join course.

## Step 3

* On the next page, **enter your email** on both fields and submit. You will be asked for a **verification code** which you will have received through the email you entered.
* Enter the code and submit. Finally (We know!) you will be prompted to create your piazza account.

  ## Step 4
  * Just enter your full name and your new password.
  * If you wish, you can pick your graduate program and major, or just select the “not pursuing degree” option.
  * Accept agreements, submit and head to the next page to choose to be involved with Piazza Careers. Hit continue and that’s it! Congratulations, you are on our forum! Enjoy!
